		<h1>My Life in a Picture</h1>
		<hr />
			<!-- This first paragraph talks about my background regarding family and work -->
		<p>My name is <b>Hallie Riley</b> and I live in a townhouse in Newark,
Delaware. I am an only child with a one year old corgi named Vinn. Once a week, I work 
together with my Aunt Erin and grandparents to help run their 2 cookie businesses, 
<a href="https://voortman.com" target=_blank">Voortman</a> and <a href=
"https://www.lindencookies.com" target=_blank">Lindens.</a> There are close to 45 flavors 
starting with the original chocolate chip to the new fudge striped almondettes. Every 
Saturday morning, we stock up our vans and cross the Delaware Memorial Bridge to deliver 
to stores all over New Jersey.</p>

			<!-- This second paragraph talks about my curricular activites recently and in 
			the past -->
		<p>Aside from the companies outside of school, I used to be apart of the 3 running 
programs at Padua and was a member in the Robotic's team for my freshman and sophomore 
year. Over the summer, I became an active volunteer for the <a href="https://rmhde.org" 
target=_blank">Ronald McDonald House,</a>which is an organization that provides for 
families of those who are sick. Currently, I've been focusing on my passion for 
photography and received an internship with <a href="https://www.allisoniannonephotography
.com" target="_blank">Allison Iannone<a/> <!-- This link shows Allion's website which 
includes her portfolio, career as a photographer, etc. --> where I'll have the opportunity
to focus on weddings, graduations, birthday parties, etc. I am also apart of the public 
speaking club, which has helped me to talk in front of large groups of people.</p>

I'm obsessed with anything lavender. My favorite books is the <i>Last Lecture</i>, which 
contains my favorite quote: <blockquote>"Experience is what you get when you didn't get 
what you wanted."</blockquote></p>
