			<!-- This first paragraph talks about my background regarding family and work -->
		<p>My name is <b>Hallie Riley</b> and I live in a townhouse in Newark,
Delaware. I am an only child with a one year old corgi named Vinn. Once a week, I work 
together with my Aunt Erin and grandparents to help run their 2 cookie businesses, 
Voortman and Lindens. There are close to 45 flavors starting with the original chocolate 
chip to the new fudge striped almondettes. Every Saturday morning, we stock up our vans 
and cross the Delaware Memorial Bridge to deliver to stores all over New Jersey.</p>

			<!-- This second paragraph talks about my curricular activites recently and in 
			the past -->
		<p>Aside from the companies outside of school, I used to be apart of the 3 running 
programs at Padua and was a member in the Robotic's team for my freshman and sophomore 
year. Over the summer, I became an active volunteer for Ronald McDonald, which is an 
organization that provides for families of those who are sick. Currently, I've been 
focusing on my passion for photography and received an internship with Allison Iannone,
where I'll have the opportunity to focus on weddings, graduations, birthday parties, etc. 
I am also apart of the public speaking club, which has helped me to talk in 
front of large groups of people.</p>

My childhood movie is <i>Ratatouille</i>, my color is yellow, and 
I'm obsessed with anything lavender. My favorite books is the <i>Last Lecture</i>, which 
contains my favorite quote: <blockquote>"Experience is what you get when you didn't get 
what you wanted."</blockquote></p>
